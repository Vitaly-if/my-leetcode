Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
Example 2:Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
class Solution {
    fun backspaceCompare(s: String, t: String): Boolean {
        return norm(s) == norm(t)
    }    
    private fun norm(s: String): String {
        val b = StringBuilder()
        var skip = 0
        for (i in s.lastIndex downTo 0) {
            when {
                s[i] == '#' -> skip++
                skip > 0 -> skip--
                else -> b.append(s[i])
            }
        }
        return b.toString()
    }
}
